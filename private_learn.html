      <p>Hi {{ first_name }}!</p>

      <p>
        My name is {{ instructor_first }} and I will be organizing the upcoming
        dbt Learn training for {{ organization }} on {{ session_days }}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please reply all to this email if you
        have not received the corresponding calendar invitations and we will be
        sure to send them your way.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a <strong>bunch of important pre-work</strong> that needs to be
        completed before the training. Please start this as soon as possible.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Pre-work Checklist:</strong></p>

              In the command line at the bottom of the IDE, type 'dbt run' and hit enter
              to ensure your project is executing without error. 
              Now you're ready to start working in dbt Cloud!

      <p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong></p>

      Post any questions or issues in the private Slack channel mentioned above so that others
      can learn from your questions as well. If you run into any issues with the 
      pre-work, there will be time during the training to debug.

      <p>Iâ€™m looking forward to learning together!</p>
